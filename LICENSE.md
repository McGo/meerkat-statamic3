* Developing a Meerkat addon and redistributing that **is** okay,
* Customizing the Meerkat addon and/or Core and distributing that to a client **is** okay,
* Customizing the Meerkat addon and/or Core and making it available outside of a developer/client relationship **is not okay**,
* Developing and distributing a theme, template, or site builder that includes Meerkat template code **is** okay as long as Meerkat is not included in the distribution package,
* Redistributing Meerkat as part of an addon bundle, site builder, etc. **is not okay**
